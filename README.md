# Big Nerd Ranch Hiring Exercise

This exercise is a Node/Express API with endpoints for creating and retreving users from a PostgreSQL database.

## Getting Started

After cloning down the repo and installing the necessary dependencies you can run the project locally on port 8080

```bash
npm clone <REPO_URL>
cd express-app
npm install  // installs dependencies -> generates node_modules folder
npm run dev  // invokes nodemon in watch mode for development
```

## ENV Variables

By default the app will attempt to connect to a deployed Postgres instance provided by Heroku. However local DB instances are also supported via two environment variables DEV_MODE, and DATABASE_URL.

If you'd like to run the db locally then export DEV_MODE=true and modify the DATABASE_URL to point to your local db.
example

```bash
export DEV_MODE=true
export DATABASE_URL=pg://<user>:<pass>@<host>:<port>/<db>?ssl=true
```

## SSL Issues

If you are encountering SSL issues in connecting to the Heroku DB, an additional environment variable may be required to access the datastore. This is a work around for a self-signed certificate generated by the pg module.

```bash
export NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
```

## Heroku

This application is currently deployed to Heroku and is available at the link below.
https://bignerdranch.herokuapp.com/

available endpoints include...
GET https://bignerdranch.herokuapp.com/users
GET https://bignerdranch.herokuapp.com/user/:userId
POST https://bignerdranch.herokuapp.com/user
POST https://bignerdranch.herokuapp.com/post
GET https://bignerdranch.herokuapp.com/posts
GET https://bignerdranch.herokuapp.com/posts/:postId

## A Note on Making POST Requests

The API is enforcing validation on both posts and users. Also, it will expect POST information to be sent as query params rather than in the body of the post. Please adhere to this format when making POST calls to the API

## Next steps

Given more time this API would likely grow to include additional libraries and functionality.
Such efforts would likely include authentication via JWTs, a content security policy library (CSP), as well as Swagger UI documentation. Further work on error handling and logging would also be nice additions to the API.
